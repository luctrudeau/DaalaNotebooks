# DaalaNotebooks
A collection of iPython notebooks detailing technical aspects of the Daala video codec in a pragmatic way.

My first draft is : [A Pragmatic Introduction to Perceptual Vector Quantization (part 1)](https://github.com/luctrudeau/DaalaNotebooks/blob/master/PVQ/PVQ.ipynb) 
 > This guide explains Perceptual Vector Quantization by presenting it in a practical context. By pratical, I mean that we will implement the Perceptual Vector Quantization in python right in this notebook. The intended audience is mainly programmers, not necessarily python programmers, and the idea is that you can leverage your programming skills to better understand Perceptual Vector Quantization.

You can view the notebook directly in [GitHub](https://github.com/luctrudeau/DaalaNotebooks/blob/master/PVQ/PVQ.ipynb) or in [nbviewer](http://nbviewer.ipython.org/github/luctrudeau/DaalaNotebooks/blob/master/PVQ/PVQ.ipynb#). However, you will need [iPython](http://ipython.org/notebook.html) in order to modify it.

Constructive critisms and improvements are welcome.
