# DaalaNotebooks
A collection of iPython notebooks detailing technical aspects of the Daala video codec in a pragmatic way.

A Pragmatic Introduction to Daala:
  * [Perceptual Vector Quantization (part 1)](https://github.com/luctrudeau/DaalaNotebooks/blob/master/PVQ/PVQ.ipynb) 
  * [Perceptual Vector Quantization (part 2)](https://github.com/luctrudeau/DaalaNotebooks/blob/master/PVQ/PVQ%202.ipynb)
  * [DCT Fundamentals](https://github.com/luctrudeau/DaalaNotebooks/blob/master/DCT/DCT%20fundamentals.ipynb)
  * Chroma from Luma (CfL)
    * [DCT Domain Subsampling](https://github.com/luctrudeau/DaalaNotebooks/blob/master/CFL/DCT-Domain%20Subsampling.ipynb)

You can view the notebook directly in GitHub or in [nbviewer](http://nbviewer.ipython.org/github/luctrudeau/DaalaNotebooks/tree/master/). However, you will need [iPython](http://ipython.org/notebook.html) in order to modify it.

I'm also prototyping with Binder [![Binder](http://mybinder.org/badge.svg)](http://mybinder.org/repo/luctrudeau/DaalaNotebooks)

Constructive critisms and improvements are welcome.
