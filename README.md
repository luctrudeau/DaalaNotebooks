# DaalaNotebooks
A collection of iPython notebooks detailing technical aspects of the Daala video codec in a pragmatic way.

I'm currently drafting notebooks on Perceptual Vector Quantization:
 * [A Pragmatic Introduction to Perceptual Vector Quantization (part 1)](https://github.com/luctrudeau/DaalaNotebooks/blob/master/PVQ/PVQ.ipynb) 
 * [A Pragmatic Introduction to Perceptual Vector Quantization (part 2)](https://github.com/luctrudeau/DaalaNotebooks/blob/master/PVQ/PVQ%202.ipynb) 

You can view the notebook directly in [GitHub](https://github.com/luctrudeau/DaalaNotebooks/blob/master/PVQ/PVQ.ipynb) or in [nbviewer](http://nbviewer.ipython.org/github/luctrudeau/DaalaNotebooks/blob/master/PVQ/PVQ.ipynb#). However, you will need [iPython](http://ipython.org/notebook.html) in order to modify it.

Constructive critisms and improvements are welcome.
